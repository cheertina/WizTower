## WizTower

A roguelike using the ROT.js library.  Following a few different tutorials as I go.


## Plans:

# Items
	* Additional basic items
	* Prefixes and suffixes
	* Special abilities

# Monsters
	* Level ranges - find different monsters as you get deeper
	* Monsters fight neutral creeps like fungus
	* Overhaul monster hunt AI
		1. List all targets in range
		2. Check sight only to those targets, instead of computing the whole FoV
		3. Prioritize targets
		
# Magic system
	* Mana - Working!
	* Spells - Working!
	
# Other
	* Ranged attacks - Working!
		Animation - maybe someday
	* Alternate/Additional dungeon layouts
